# HTTP/2 Playground

[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) spec was [recently formally approved](http://www.techspot.com/news/59785-http-standard-gets-first-major-revision-16-years.html) so this is my little playground project for tinkering and learning. Feel free to clone, fork, expirement and contribute if you feel like it!

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

Start server:

```
npm start
```

You can either hit in a HTTP/2 supported browser or use the client in this project with:

```
npm run client
```
